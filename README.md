# Cricket-Score-Board
The project has three modules: frontend, backend, and API. The frontend uses HTML &amp; CSS to display match details like runs, overs, and wickets. The backend, written in C, tracks runs, wickets, and overs. The API, built with Flask, handles GET &amp; POST requests to update scores. Optionally, a database stores match history and player stats.
